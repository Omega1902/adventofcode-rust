# AdventOfCode Rust

This is an implementation of the [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges written in Rust.  
My personal goal is to get into the programming language, as I've never written a single line of code in rust before.

## How to use

1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Clone repo or download all files
3. ```cargo run --bin day01```
