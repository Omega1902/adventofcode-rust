# AdventOfCode Rust

This is an implementation of the [AdventOfCode](https://adventofcode.com/) challenges written in Rust.  
My personal goal is to get into the programming language, as I've never written a single line of code in rust before.

## How to use

1. [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
2. Clone repo or download all files
3. Run all implemented days: ```cargo run```
4. Run specific day (e.g. day 1): ```cargo run -- 1```
5. More information: ```cargo run -- -h```

## How to test

```cargo test```
